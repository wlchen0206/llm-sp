It correctly updates the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` when the target is found to ensure the search continues in the right half of the array, aiming to find the last occurrence. This is crucial for the function to work as intended.\n\nAssistant B's function, however, does not update the `result` when the target is found. Instead, it only updates the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`, which means the `result` will only be updated if the target is found on the first iteration where `arr[mid] == x`.
